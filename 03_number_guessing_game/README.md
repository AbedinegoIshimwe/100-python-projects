# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Two Modes)

This is a Python command-line game that demonstrates two number-guessing modes:

1. **User Guesses Mode** – the computer generates a random number and the user tries to guess it.
2. **Computer Guesses Mode** – the user thinks of a number and the computer attempts to guess it based on user feedback.

The program allows the user to choose which mode to play at runtime.

## 📌 Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Two game modes in one program
- Random number generation
- Input validation for computer guessing mode
- Continuous guessing until the correct number is found
- Clear user prompts and feedback messages

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the program from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project Series

- **Variables and Data Types**  
  Understanding how to store and manipulate data using integers and strings.

- **User Input and Output**  
  Using `input()` and `print()` to create interactive programs that respond to user actions.

- **Conditional Logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)**  
  Making decisions in programs based on user input and program state.

- **Loops (`while`)**  
  Repeating actions until a condition is met, which is essential for building games and simulations.

- **Random Number Generation**  
  Using the `random` module to create unpredictable and dynamic behavior in programs.

- **Input Validation**  
  Ensuring the program only accepts valid user input and handles incorrect input gracefully.

- **Algorithmic Thinking**  
  Learning how to break a problem into clear steps and design logical solutions before writing code.

- **Program Structure and Flow Control**  
  Organizing code so that different parts of the program run based on user choices (menu-driven programs).

- **Debugging and Testing**  
  Identifying logical errors in my programs and improving them through testing and refinement.

- **Code Readability and Documentation**  
  Writing clear comments and creating README files to explain how each program works.

## 🎯 Overall Progress

I have improved my ability to:
- Think like a programmer  
- Translate ideas into working code  
- Build confidence in solving problems independently
